# Intelligence SOTA Report — 2026-05-27

**TL;DR:** Self-regulated simulative planning (arXiv:2605.22138) lets 8B agents match 120–355B systems using 25.8–95.3% fewer reasoning tokens; Ruflo's flat chain-of-thought routing has no equivalent depth-allocation primitive — this is the highest-leverage intelligence improvement available in 2026.

## Ruflo Current Capability

| Component | State | Gap |

| 3-tier model routing (ADR-026) | Complexity-based Tier 1/2/3 | No depth allocation within tier |
| 4-step intelligence pipeline | RETRIEVE→JUDGE→DISTILL→CONSOLIDATE | No simulative planning before tool calls |
| SONA | <0.05ms pattern matching | No skill lifecycle (create/evaluate/refine) |

| Memory | HNSW + AgentDB hybrid | No temporal abstraction at 1M+ token scale |
| Benchmark harness | None | Cannot measure GAIA/SWE-bench regression |

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Implement `SimulativePlanningRouter` (ADR-131)** — add a selective-depth tier to ADR-026: for tasks with estimated horizon >5 steps, invoke a simulative forward pass before committing to tool calls. Target ≤30ms overhead, ≥20% token reduction on multi-step tasks. Architecture decision required (changes routing contract in `@claude-flow/hooks` route hook).

2. **Add skill lifecycle to SONA** — extend the SONA pattern store with MUSE-Autoskill evaluation gates: skills failing 3× consecutive invocations enter quarantine; 10× successes promote to `high-trust` with preloading. Extend `hooks post-task` worker. Implementation-level — no new ADR.

3. **Integrate GAIA subset benchmark harness** — add `npx claude-flow performance benchmark --suite agent` running a 10-question GAIA subset with score vs SOTA delta. Enables nightly regression detection. Implementation-level — no new ADR.
